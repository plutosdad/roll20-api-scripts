Introduction:
This script is a re-work of "WhatSaywithUnknown.js" by derekkoehl which is an enhancement on "What Did He Say?" by Stephen S.

Command 1:
!theLanguage {theText}
Example:
> !Draconic hello there dragonborn
Result:
- If the player who enters this is speaking as a character that has Draconic, under the languages on their character sheet, they will say "hello there dragonborn" in Draconic. Any player who is currently online and is speaking as a character that also has Draconic on their character sheet will be whispered "hello there dragonborn". Others will be whispered symbols representing the language.
- If the player who enters this is speaking as a character that does not have Draconic(under languages on their character sheet), they will "pretend to speak" Draconic.
- If the player who enters this is speaking as a player, they will be notified that players cannot speak character languages.
- GMs can speak any language with any player or character

Command 2:
!setLanguageTag {attribute name}
Example:
> !setLanguageTag playerlanguages
Result:
- If the player who enters this is a GM and playerlanguages is the name of a character sheet attribute in the campaign, the script will use "playerlanguages" when it searches character sheet attributes for player's languages (instead of the default "prolanguages")

Command 3:
!deleteLanguage {language name}
Example:
!deleteLanguage Dwarven
Result:
- If the player is a GM, Dwarven will be deleted as a language

Command 4.
!createLanguage {language name} {seed nubmer} {parent language}
Example:
!createLanguage Underdwarven 5 Dwarven
Result:
- If the player is a GM, Underdwarven will be created as a seed 5 language of Dwarven

Languages:
Abyssal Aquan Auran Celestial Common Draconic Druidic
Druidic Dwarven Elven Giant Gnome Goblin Gnoll
Halfling Ignan Infernal Orc Sylvan Terran Thieves'Cant
Undercommon Unknown

Future Plans:
Create command for adding customized languages
