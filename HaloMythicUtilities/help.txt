## Halo Mythic Utilities

* !specdmg [DAMAGE#] [PIERCE#]
** This command will take attack info then automatically roll on the hit location table, then the finger/toe table if necessary, then ask you for the armor for that location

* !armor [ARMOR#]
** This command must be entered after prompted by !specdmg. After passing the armor in the final damage is calculated and information about the attack results is returned
